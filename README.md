# Tile Game

## Introduction
This was one of my first major approaches to game development where my goal was to really expand my recent learning about p5.js while also having fun. Up until this point, most of the projects I have worked on were very finance-related and, for a lack of a better word, more 'serious' so this was an opportunity I had to go in a drastically different direction.

This game was part of my NYU senior Interactive Computing Class with professor Craig Kapp.

### Technology Stack
JavaScript, CSS, p5.js
