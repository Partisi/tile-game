# Interactive Computing

## Midterm
This README serves as only a guide for some assignments and should NOT be used to rely on full class progress (as I do not update here frequently).

For the midterm project, you may see my progress in a standard Agile board in [projects](https://github.com/Partisi/interactive-computing/projects/1) with a single sprint. Although I am a single person in this group, I still find it absolutely critical to continue adopting real industry standards and helps my natural severe lack of planning & preperation.

Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCar45dJ8L1Wv3nfpyRrZqVT_WLu2yMLQf1OhBMhiVQ/edit) to my google doc that explains a bit more of my midterm project.
