        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Club P3nguin is a tile-based adventure game that focuses on you, as a player, defeating a magical demon to
            recover a
            stolen magical snowman from a small village! The game has 3 dungeons that revolve around some puzzles and
            fighting enemies to get the keys. Once the player picks up the all 3 keys, you are then able to fight the
            final boss!
        <p>A strong focus of this game was to make the game feel as alive as possible. Club P3nguin being based around
            snow allows there to be more advanced ways of the player interacting with the world compared to that of a
            simple forest map. The most obvious example to this is live snow falling down throughout the game to really
            make the player feel as if you are exploring an icy world.</p>
